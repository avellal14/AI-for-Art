# Duke AI-for-Art

This repository contains code for my submission to Duke's 2019 Spring AI for Art competition. The code in this repository is a modified PyTorch implementation of the CycleGAN architecture detailed by Zhu et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf). It was used to generate a collage of images of various Duke campus landmarks in the style of various Renaissance painters. 

Some example images are below:
